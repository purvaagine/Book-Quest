# BOOK QUEST 📚

**BOOK QUEST** is an AI-powered conversational tool designed to interact with PDF files. It allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions, and receive answers while highlighting relevant content directly on the PDF pages. This project leverages OpenAI's language models, document processing libraries, and Gradio for building an interactive user interface.

## **Features**
- **Upload PDF Files**: Accepts PDF files as input for processing.
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Uses OpenAI's language model to provide conversational responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
- **PDF Rendering**: Displays the specific page of the PDF containing the answer with highlights.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions and receive answers in real-time.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Requires an OpenAI API key to function.
- **Clear Chat History**: Ability to clear the chat history to start a new session.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `gradio`: For building the web-based user interface.
  - `langchain`: For managing language model interactions and conversational retrieval.
  - `PyPDFLoader`: For loading and parsing PDF files.
  - `Chroma`: For embedding and searching document content.
  - `fitz` (PyMuPDF): For rendering PDF pages as images.
  - `Pillow`: For image manipulation and drawing.
- **OpenAI GPT**: For generating conversational responses.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for a polished user interface.
